  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a significant component of the global carbon (C) cycle. Changes in SOC storage affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations on decadal to centennial timescales. The C-TOOL model was developed to simulate farm- and regional-scale effects of management on medium- to long-term SOC storage in the profile of well-drained agricultural mineral soils. C-TOOL uses three SOC pools for both the topsoil (0–25cm) and the subsoil (25–100cm), and applies temperature-dependent first order kinetics to regulate C turnover. C-TOOL also enables the simulation of 14C turnover. The simple model structure facilitates calibration and requires few inputs (mean monthly air temperature, soil clay content, soil C/N ratio and C in organic inputs). The model was parameterised using data from 19 treatments drawn from seven long-term field experiments in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. It was found that the initial SOC content had to be optimised for each experiment, but also that one set of values for other model parameters could be applied at all sites. With this set of parameters, C-TOOL can be applied more widely to evaluate effects of management options on SOC storage in temperate agricultural soils. C-TOOL simulates observed losses of SOC in soils under intensive agricultural use and the gain in SOC derived from large inputs of animal manure and inclusion of perennial grassland. The model simulates changes in SOC for the entire profile, but lack of data on subsoil SOC storage hampers a proper model evaluation. Experimental verification of management effects on subsoil C storage, subsoil C inputs from roots, and vertical transport of C in the soil profile remains prioritised research areas.},

  abstract = {Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It accounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in formation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest terrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks to climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the global patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this process and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar litter mass loss measurements (nearly 10,000 data points derived from approximately 70,000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model called Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the effects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little systematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial litter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables. Illustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example calculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass still remaining after 2 decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous litter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a direct result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied according to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions and ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was adequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences in litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as statistically significant.},

  abstract  = {Rothc-26.3 is a model of the turnover of organic carbon in non-waterlogged soils that allows for the effects of soil type, temperature, moisture content and plant cover on the turnover process. It uses a monthly time step to calculate total organic carbon (t C ha-1), microbial biomass carbon (t C ha-1) and $\Delta$14C (from which the radiocarbon age of the soil can be calculated) on a years-to-centuries timescale (Jenkinson, 1990; Jenkinson and Coleman, 1994; Jenkinson et al., 1987; Jenkinson et al., 1991; Jenkinson et al., 1992). It needs few inputs and those it needs are easily obtainable. It is an extension of the earlier model described by Jenkinson and Rayner (1977), and by Hart (1984). Needless to say, it has many ideas in common with other contemporary turnover models, notably CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988) and Van Veen and Paul's model (Van Veen and Paul, 1981).},
